# additional-certifications

## About this repository

There are several resources that have helped outside of my program with Georgia Tech. I decided it would be helpful to collect some of the other resources that have, and still are, helping me along the way. For convenience I am going to add all the additional certifications and keep them here for easy reference. There are too many to add to my portfolio already, and I am constantly expanding my knowlege. I am enrolled in two additional programs right now, I will be adding those as soon as they are completed. And they won't be the last. This is a journey that never ends, this pursuit of knowlege; it will never end.
